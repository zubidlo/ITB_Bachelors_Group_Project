We need to cooperate on design documentation.
Because I want to avoid git merge conflicts on microsoft word documents,
each of us work on his own part of the document (name.docx) 
and then when all done MIchael is going to merge it manually together

You can see your doc in this dir and if you open it I mentioned parts you do in there
