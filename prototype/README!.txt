here we build our application

there is going to be only one file in this directory: "index.html"
it's gonna be html5, I already ;have made template

css goes to css, html to html directory etc

please validate your html before every push to github origin repository at : http://validator.w3.org/
css validate: http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/

general workflow

1.git pull origin
2 work .....
3 validate html and css if some changes
4 git add -A
5 git commit -m "some meaningfull message about work done"
6 git push origin

If any conflicts occur no panic. Can be resolved or rolled back easily.
Don't do too much work between commits thought. In other words, commit often.
